# Introduction to Notebook Promotion Pipeline

Welcome to the Notebook Promotion Pipeline! This pipeline streamlines the process of promoting notebooks across different environments in your Azure Databricks workspace. Whether you're moving from development to staging or staging to production, this pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reliability in your notebook deployments.

## Key Features:

- **Environment-Agnostic Configuration:** The pipeline is designed to be environment-agnostic, allowing you to promote notebooks seamlessly across different environments without the need for environment-specific configurations.

- **Flexible Promotion:** Whether you're promoting individual notebooks or entire folders, this pipeline offers flexibility in promoting your assets, accommodating various deployment scenarios.

- **Version Control Integration:** Integrated with version control systems such as Azure Devops, the pipeline ensures that all changes to notebooks are tracked and auditable, providing transparency and accountability throughout the deployment process.

- **Promotion to Enviornments:** Incorporating ADO Environments approval checks to control deployments to production environments.

- **Customizable Deployment Strategy:** Tailor the deployment strategy to suit your organization's specific requirements, whether it's a continuous deployment approach or a scheduled release cycle.

## Pipeline Structure:

- **Source Stage:** Fetches the notebooks from the source environment, typically the development environment, and triggers the deployment process.

- **Promotion Stages:** Consists of one or more stages representing the target environments (e.g., staging, production). Each stage deploys the notebooks to the respective environment, following the defined deployment strategy.



## Getting Started:

To get started with the Notebook Promotion Pipeline, simply configure the pipeline parameters to match your environment settings and deployment preferences. Once configured, trigger the pipeline manually or automate it to run on specific events such as code commits or scheduled intervals.
